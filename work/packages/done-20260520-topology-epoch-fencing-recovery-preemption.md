## Why

State the focused concern and why this package owns it.

## Scope Basis

Approved maintenance scope or roadmap row.

## Workflow Lane

- Selected lane: `runtime-owner-boundary`
- Why this lane is sufficient: owner, boundary, core logic brief, and proof ladder are bounded to this package.
- Escalation trigger to a heavier lane: runtime ownership, shared contract, or representative scenario evidence changes.

## Core Logic Brief

- Canonical outcome: control-plane / publication-recovery emits the package outcome for System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation.
- Inputs/signals: node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js.
- State model or invariant: The control-plane / publication-recovery decision table in the Causal Decision Contract maps System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation and route evidence to one emitted outcome: Implement topology epoch fencer and recovery lease preemption rules in control-plane.
- Non-goals and forbidden interpretations: Do not reinterpret downstream evidence, widen forbidden boundaries, or patch symptoms outside this package. Forbidden scope: none beyond lane and package scope.
- Proof mapping: Implementation and tests must prove the control-plane / publication-recovery invariant before representative or closure proof is accepted.
- Wrong-slice trigger: Stop or split if the canonical outcome changes owner, boundary, required action, or needs files outside the declared scope.

## Causal Decision Contract

| Signal | Normalized value | Owner interpretation | Emitted outcome | Expected delta | Disproof probe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| route owner/boundary | control-plane / publication-recovery / System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation | control-plane owns this decision before downstream consumers reinterpret it | Implement topology epoch fencer and recovery lease preemption rules in control-plane | Classify whether fresh representative evidence is green, reduced, migrated, same-frontier, architecture-gap, contradictory, or needs a bounded successor before runtime promotion. | node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js |
| scope boundary | lane and package scope only | proof that needs forbidden scope means this package is the wrong slice | stop, split, or migrate owner boundary | no widened runtime scope inside this package | npm run work:advance -- --check |

- Anti-symptom rationale: This package changes or classifies control-plane / publication-recovery directly; it does not patch downstream symptoms or widen forbidden scope.
- Falsifying focused probe: `node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js`
- Competing explanations: At minimum compare System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation against downstream symptom lag, stale instrumentation, and wrong-owner routing before implementation.
- Systemic interaction scan: Check producer, consumer, admission/gating, retry/lifecycle, and evidence-generation effects before assigning the next owner slice.
- Ping-pong stop rule: Do not bounce between adjacent owners on the same unchanged artifact; require fresh representative evidence, a concrete metric reduction, owner/boundary migration proof, or architecture/human stop before another local patch.
- Oscillation guard: If fresh representative evidence returns the same frontier or another symptom-shaped result, the next package must show concrete reduction, migration, green, or an architecture/human stop before another local patch.

## Decision Experiment Gate

- Decision question: Does control-plane / publication-recovery still own System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation, and what exact producer, consumer, or contract fact must move before implementation is justified?
- Architecture review: Before runtime edits, confirm whether this is still a local owner-boundary route, an owner-boundary migration, an architecture/contract gap, or a human route.
- Competing hypotheses: System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation is real owner debt; the visible symptom is downstream lag; instrumentation or stale evidence is misleading; a different owner boundary owns the next move.
- Pre-edit focused probe: `node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js`
- Success metrics: Classify whether fresh representative evidence is green, reduced, migrated, same-frontier, architecture-gap, contradictory, or needs a bounded successor before runtime promotion.; at least one concrete metric, count, frontier, migration, or representative-green condition must move.
- Representative rerun: `npm run work:package:route-after-rerun -- --artifact none --owner control-plane --boundary publication-recovery --dominant-reason System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation`
- Kill rule: If fresh representative evidence returns the same frontier and dominant reason with no concrete metric reduction, stop for architecture or human escalation instead of opening another local patch.


## Expected Representative Delta

- Baseline artifact: `none`
- Expected delta: Classify whether fresh representative evidence is green, reduced, migrated, same-frontier, architecture-gap, contradictory, or needs a bounded successor before runtime promotion.
- Local proof class: focused owner or diagnostic proof only; it is not representative-green proof.
- Representative proof class: fresh representative rerun or canonical route-after-rerun result.
- Stop if unchanged: same-frontier with no concrete metric or shape reduction triggers architecture or human escalation instead of another local patch.

## Rerun Decision Gate

- Source artifact: `none`
- Route owner: `control-plane`
- Route boundary: `publication-recovery`
- Route dominant reason: `System-wide topology epoch preemption implementation`
- Route causal outcome: `pending-before-rerun`
- Stop mode: `pending-before-rerun`
- Next lane: `runtime-owner-boundary`
- Required after rerun: route-after-rerun, Sprint Strategy Brief and Current Edge Card update, current-blocker refresh, and pre-implementation validation.

## Classification Efficiency

- Default mode: `inline-gate-default`
- Separate package reason: `not-needed-inline-gate`
- Evidence budget: `one-artifact`; `two-or-three-canonical-commands`
- Decision record: Keep classification inside the package unless route truth changes.
- Successor action: `update-current-package`
- Runtime promotion rule: Stable owner/boundary routes move to runtime-owner-boundary work.

## LLM Tool-First Contract

Before raw JSON, raw logs, broad file search, oversized segment files, or ad hoc `jq`, use the canonical workflow command that owns the question:

1. Package metadata or ledger edits: `npm run work:package:doctor -- --suggest <package>`, `npm run work:package:doctor -- --fix-dry-run <package>`, `npm run work:package:schema`, or `npm run work:package:new -- ...`.
2. Representative evidence: `npm run work:evidence-summary -- <artifact>` plus any focused extractor for this failure class.
3. Owner discovery: `npm run analyze:owner-files -- <owner> [boundary]`.
4. Subagent sequencing: `npm run work:subagent-prompt -- --role <role> --package <package>`.
5. Large-file cleanup: `npm run work:oversized-next -- --markdown`.

If a fallback to raw JSON, raw logs, or ad hoc `jq` is needed, record which canonical extractor was tried and why it was insufficient.

## Workflow Acceleration Contract

1. Use `npm run work:advance -- --check` before adding more package prose; it combines doctor, subagent-next, and entry/pre-implementation validation.
2. Keep the durable proof ladder to 3-5 commands by default: prefer `npm run work:scenario-route -- <artifact>` for representative routing, one focused test or extractor, and validation. Add static guardrails only when implementation files changed.
3. If this package only changes package, sprint, tracker, or ledger files, the next pass must run representative evidence, close as classification-only, open a concrete bug package, or present a human gate.
4. Once an architecture gate has a selected route, do not open another gate unless fresh canonical evidence contradicts the selected route.
5. For bounded experiments, move quickly inside the inherited owner boundary, but do not merge without the stated focused proof and canonical evidence movement.

## In Scope

1. src/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.js
2. test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js

## Out Of Scope

1. Runtime ownership changes.

## Model Fit

- Package class: `runtime-owner-boundary`
- Intended minimum model: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Scope shape: `bounded-owner-runtime/current-frontier`
- Output profile: `medium`
- Owned files: `src/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.js`, `test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js`
- Forbidden files: `src/`
- Frozen decisions: package scope and lane stay bounded unless explicitly escalated.
- Escalation triggers: owned files expand beyond this package, runtime ownership changes, or representative scenario evidence changes.
- Focused proof: `node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js`
- Model ledger advisory: `escalate`

## Model-Fit Split

- Target executor: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Allowed decision depth: single owner-boundary execution after higher-model route selection
- Safe to execute when:
1. owner, boundary, write scope, forbidden scope, proof, and kill rule stay as declared
2. the executor does not need to choose architecture, migrate ownership, or reinterpret representative evidence
3. the first focused proof gives a clear pass, fail, or escalate signal
- Split or escalate when:
1. write scope expands beyond the declared lower-model lane
2. proof requires forbidden scope, cross-owner reasoning, or architecture route selection
3. the implementation needs to decide system behavior instead of executing a named local mechanism
- Candidate lower-model child packages:
1. Split mechanical cleanup into mechanical-maintenance / gpt-5.3-codex-spark.
2. Split focused tests or fixtures into test-only-proof / gpt-5.3-codex-spark.
3. Split one same-owner hypothesis into bounded-experiment / gpt-5.3-codex-spark.
4. Keep cross-file owner runtime integration in this package unless it contracts to one runtime file.

## Execution Evidence

Preferred closure evidence for new packages. Agent identity is optional provenance; implementation proof, scope, status, and parent revalidation are blocking.
Use legacy subagent ledgers only when the package explicitly requires sequenced subagents.
If review directly fixes metadata-only findings, record `review-fixed-metadata-only` as execution evidence and continue without a separate fix package.

- [ ] review: status: not-needed; evidence: lane permits direct implementation or package review found no required fix; next: implementation.
- [ ] implementation: status: validated; evidence: <focused proof commands and results>; parent revalidated focused proof: yes; next: closure or successor action.
- [ ] repair: status: validated; evidence: `npm run work:repair` refreshed generated current-blocker and Current Edge Card when needed; next: validation.

## Validation

1. node --test test/control-plane/publication-recovery-evidence.test.js
