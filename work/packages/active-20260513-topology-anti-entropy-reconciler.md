## Why

Events are acceleration, not durable truth. This package owns the periodic
durable reconciliation layer that compares topology truth surfaces and
enqueues exact owner-key repair without adding local fallback mutation.

## Scope Basis

Roadmap Phase `0.1 - Internal Coherence`: topology workflow stabilization,
failure simulations, and production guarantees. This package belongs to
`work/sprints/active-2026-q2-topology-convergence-ship-shape.md`.

## Workflow Lane

- Selected lane: `runtime-owner-boundary`
- Why this lane is sufficient: the package targets one runtime owner boundary
  for durable topology reconciliation.
- Escalation trigger to a heavier lane: runtime ownership, shared contract, or representative scenario evidence changes.

## LLM Tool-First Contract

Before raw JSON, raw logs, broad file search, oversized segment files, or ad hoc `jq`, use the canonical workflow command that owns the question:

1. Package metadata or ledger edits: `npm run work:package:doctor -- --suggest <package>`, `npm run work:package:doctor -- --fix-dry-run <package>`, `npm run work:package:schema`, or `npm run work:package:new -- ...`.
2. Representative evidence: `npm run work:evidence-summary -- <artifact>` plus any focused extractor for this failure class.
3. Owner discovery: `npm run analyze:owner-files -- <owner> [boundary]`.
4. Subagent sequencing: `npm run work:subagent-prompt -- --role <role> --package <package>`.
5. Large-file cleanup: `npm run work:oversized-next -- --markdown`.

If a fallback to raw JSON, raw logs, or ad hoc `jq` is needed, record which canonical extractor was tried and why it was insufficient.

## In Scope

1. Add low-rate durable truth reconciliation that enqueues exact owner-key
   work for nodes, readiness leases, partition services, replica operations,
   placement targets, and active publication state.
2. Ensure the reconciler never mutates another owner's state directly.
3. Update this package metadata before activation with exact write scope,
   candidate runtime files, commit scope, and required subagent proof.

## Out Of Scope

1. Local fallback repair writes outside owner-key intents.
2. Failure-transition-specific repair intent creation already owned by the
   failure repair package.
3. Pro or Enterprise behavior.

## Model Fit

- Package class: `representative-frontier-closure`
- Intended minimum model: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Scope shape: `owner-boundary-contraction/current-frontier`
- Owned files: `work/packages/<this-package>.md`
- Forbidden files: none selected before activation; activation must name exact
  runtime write scope and forbidden files.
- Frozen decisions: package scope and lane stay bounded unless explicitly escalated.
- Escalation triggers: owned files expand beyond this package, runtime ownership changes, or representative scenario evidence changes.
- Focused proof: `git diff --check`
- Model ledger advisory: `escalate`

## Validation

1. `git diff --check -- <files>`
