## Why

Split, merge, move, route, and stale-route rejection need one versioned
partition descriptor contract. This package owns that descriptor epoch so
consumers stop inferring partition freshness from cache age or incidental
service rows.

## Scope Basis

Roadmap Phase `0.1 - Internal Coherence`: topology workflow stabilization,
failure simulations, and production guarantees. This package belongs to
`work/sprints/active-2026-q2-topology-convergence-ship-shape.md`.

## Workflow Lane

- Selected lane: `runtime-owner-boundary`
- Why this lane is sufficient: the package targets one runtime owner boundary
  for partition descriptor versioning and direct consumers.
- Escalation trigger to a heavier lane: runtime ownership, shared contract, or representative scenario evidence changes.

## LLM Tool-First Contract

Before raw JSON, raw logs, broad file search, oversized segment files, or ad hoc `jq`, use the canonical workflow command that owns the question:

1. Package metadata or ledger edits: `npm run work:package:doctor -- --suggest <package>`, `npm run work:package:doctor -- --fix-dry-run <package>`, `npm run work:package:schema`, or `npm run work:package:new -- ...`.
2. Representative evidence: `npm run work:evidence-summary -- <artifact>` plus any focused extractor for this failure class.
3. Owner discovery: `npm run analyze:owner-files -- <owner> [boundary]`.
4. Subagent sequencing: `npm run work:subagent-prompt -- --role <role> --package <package>`.
5. Large-file cleanup: `npm run work:oversized-next -- --markdown`.

If a fallback to raw JSON, raw logs, or ad hoc `jq` is needed, record which canonical extractor was tried and why it was insufficient.

## In Scope

1. Make partition descriptors versioned routing truth for split, merge, move,
   and stale-route rejection.
2. Cut direct consumers over to descriptor-version outcomes instead of cache
   freshness or incidental rows.
3. Update this package metadata before activation with exact write scope,
   candidate runtime files, commit scope, and required subagent proof.

## Out Of Scope

1. Membership epoch implementation unless descriptor epoch explicitly consumes
   its completed contract.
2. User-facing partition management APIs.
3. Pro or Enterprise behavior.

## Model Fit

- Package class: `representative-frontier-closure`
- Intended minimum model: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Scope shape: `owner-boundary-contraction/current-frontier`
- Owned files: `work/packages/<this-package>.md`
- Forbidden files: none selected before activation; activation must name exact
  runtime write scope and forbidden files.
- Frozen decisions: package scope and lane stay bounded unless explicitly escalated.
- Escalation triggers: owned files expand beyond this package, runtime ownership changes, or representative scenario evidence changes.
- Focused proof: `git diff --check`
- Model ledger advisory: `escalate`

## Validation

1. `git diff --check -- <files>`
