## Why

Describe the problem being solved.

## Scope Basis

## Invariants

1. Correctness rule that must not regress.
2. Ownership or architecture rule that must not regress.
3. Validation rule that must not regress.

## Shared Boundary Contract

Required when adding or reshaping a shared runtime boundary.

- Semantic owner:
- Canonical contract shape / vocabulary:
- Allowed consumers:
- Prohibited reinterpretations:
- Primary diagnostics / proof surfaces:

## Detection / Analysis Tasks

- [ ] Build the concern inventory.
- [ ] Build the semantic-question matrix.
- [ ] Detect duplicate ownership.
- [ ] Detect implicit state machines.
- [ ] Detect branch lattices.

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Add guardrail tests first.
- [ ] Collapse to one canonical owner path.
- [ ] Remove or wrap parallel paths.
- [ ] Tighten static guardrails.

## Residual Closure Inventory

- [ ] Owner-path cutovers are complete.
- [ ] Tail consumers are cut over.
- [ ] Diagnostics, admin, and reporting surfaces match the new contract.
- [ ] Superseded paths, booleans, or vocabulary are deleted.
- [ ] Required proof layers are complete.

## Validation

1. Targeted unit tests.
2. Targeted integration tests.
3. Distributed harness scenarios.
4. Complexity and dependency checks.

## Done When

1. The canonical owner/path is in place.
2. Parallel implementations are removed or downgraded.
3. Required tests pass.
4. Follow-up work, if any, is split into new idea or package files.
